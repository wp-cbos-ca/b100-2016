Freezes all core, theme and plugin updates, and hides <strike>all</strike> (most) update notices.

== Description ==

WP Site DNA was named as such to represent the fact it encapsulates the entire site configuration in a set of stand alone files. These files then use functions included in the WordPress core to configure the site in the way specified. This allows for fewer errors and missed settings on install, and fewer keystrokes and clicks to establish the initial settings.

This method could be used to ascertain and capture the user configuration in advance of the site actually being built so that, once a site is actually installed, this pre-captured configuration can then be implemented with a single click. This method is also adaptable, so that if the core configuration changes, the DNA (or RNA actually), can be modified to follow suit.

The configuration (DNA) plugin separates out the data (the genome) from the functions that implement the genome so that this configuration can be easily updated without affecting other parts of the "cell structure". In addition, (to make bioengineers a little jealous) this genome comes with a set of "dip switches" so that each individual part (the A-T, G-C pairs) can be turned on or off individually, without affecting other parts of the "genome". Now if only life were this simple!

== Installation ==

1. Upload `plugin-name.php` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
