A very simple plugin to make your site run lightning fast with caching.

== Description ==

Simple Cache was constructed after getting frustrated with the major caching plugins available and building sites with developer-only complex caching solutions that get millions of page views per day. Simple Cache promises the following:

* Extremely simple one-click install. There is an on-off switch. That's it. No need to wade through 50 complicated settings.
* Simple Cache makes your site run very fast so you can handle lots of traffic.
* Extremely easy to delete. Don't like the plugin? You can remove it, and your website won't break.
* Easily clear the cache if you need to.
* Enable gzip compression
* Want to get advanced with object caching (Memached or Redis)? An advanced mode is available that will automatically setup [Batcache](https://wordpress.org/plugins/batcache/) and [Memcached](https://wordpress.org/plugins/memcached/)/[Redis](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-redis/) for you.

If you need your site to run fast, don't have time to mess with complicated settings, and have been frustrated by other caching plugins, give Simple Cache a try.
